#	Spring Bean Life Cycle

-	Spring bean will be created and managed by Spring container
-	Spring bean life cycle will be managed by spring container


##	Types of bean life cycle events

-	The life cycle of beans consist of call back methods which can be categorized broadly in two groups:

	-	Post-Initialization 
	-	Pre-Destruction 
	


## Custom init() and destroy() methods in bean configuration xml file

-	The default init() and destroy() methods in bean configuration file can be defined in two ways:

	-	Bean local definition applicable to a single bean
	-	Global definition applicable to all beans defined in beans context



##	Bean local definition


-	beans.xml:

			<beans>
				<bean id="demoBean" class="com.guru.bharath.task.DemoBean"
								init-method="customInit"
								destroy-method="customDestroy"></bean>
			</beans>
			
	
##	Global definition
-	No need to define for every beans and will applicable for all the beans
-	They are useful when we have a pattern of defining common method names such as init() and destroy() for all your beans consistently

			<beans default-init-method="customInit" default-destroy-method="customDestroy">  
						<bean id="demoBean" class="com.guru.bharath.task.DemoBean"></bean>
			</beans>	
		
	
-	Java program to show methods configured in bean XML configuration file.
	
				
				public class DemoBean
				{
					public void customInit()
					{
						System.out.println("Method customInit() invoked...");
					}
				 
					public void customDestroy()
					{
						System.out.println("Method customDestroy() invoked...");
					}
				}

##	Spring Bean Life Cycle – @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations

-	Spring 2.5 onwards, we can use annotations also for specifying life cycle methods using @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations


	-	@PostConstruct annotated method will be invoked after the bean has been constructed using default constructor and just before it’s instance is returned to requesting object
	-	@PreDestroy annotated method is called just before the bean is about be destroyed inside bean container
	
	
-	Java program to show usage of annotation configuration to control using annotations.

				public class DemoBean
				{
					@PostConstruct
					public void customInit()
					{
						System.out.println("Method customInit() invoked...");
					}
					 
					@PreDestroy
					public void customDestroy()
					{
						System.out.println("Method customDestroy() invoked...");
					}
				}
