#	Spring Core Interview Questions

-	Spring is a dependency injection framework
-	Spring framework provides infrastructure support for developing java applications
-	Spring handles infrastructure part so that we can focus on applications and business part
-	At present there are more than 20 modules
	
	-	core
	-	orm
	-	test
	-	web
	-	aop
	-	cloud
	-	data
	-	webflux
	-	messaging
	
	
##	What are the benefits of using Spring Framework?

-	Spring Ioc Container
-	Spring supports DI of beans
-	Spring doesn't reinvent the wheel, truly it makes use of existing technologies like ORM, logging, Quartz and provides best integration support for them
	-	So that infrastructure can be setup very quickly and easier manner
-	Spring is organized in a modular fashion, we can use whichever package we were interested in without worrying about others
-	Spring has first class support for unit testing
-	Spring-Web framework is well designed for web MVC framework
-	Spring provides consistent transaction management support


##	What is Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection?

-	IOC is design paradigm with goal of loose-coupling b/w modules or components
-	DI is design pattern, to inject that required beans to other beans at runtime




##	Explain IoC in Spring Framework?

-	The BeanFactory interface and ApplicationContext interface provides the spring ioc container
-	It will scans all the beans register them and manage their life-cycle
-	The BeanFactory interface is the central IoC container interface in Spring
-	The ApplicationContext interface builds on top of the BeanFactory (it is a sub-interface) 
	-	And adds other functionality such as easier integration with Spring’s AOP features, message resource handling
	
	
##	Difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext?

-	BeanFactory Container:

	-	A BeanFactory is like a factory class that contains a collection of beans
	-	The BeanFactory holds Bean Definitions of multiple beans within itself 
	-	And then instantiates the bean whenever asked for by clients. 
	-	BeanFactory is able to create associations between collaborating objects as they are instantiated


-	Application Context

	-	an application context is same as a bean factory. Both load bean definitions, wire beans together, and dispense beans upon request
	-	But it also provides:
		-	
		-	A means for resolving text messages, including support for internationalization.
		-	A generic way to load file resources.
		-	Events to beans that are registered as listeners
		-	Enterprise support 
		
	-	Common ApplicationContext implements were
		- 	ClassPathXmlAppliationContext
		-	FileSystemXmlApplicationContext
		-	XmlWebApplicationContext
		
		
##	In how many ways, you can configure Spring into our application?

	-	XML Based Configuration
	-	Annotation-based configuration
	-	Java-based configuration

##	What is Spring XML-Based Configuration?

	-	dependencies and the services needed by beans are specified in configuration files, which are typically in an XML format
	-	These configuration files usually start with <beans> tag and contain a lot of bean definitions
	-	Spring XML Configuration uses Spring namespaces to make available the sets of XML tags used in the configuration; 
		-	the main Spring namespaces are: context, beans, jdbc, tx, aop, mvc, aso
		
##	What is Spring Java-Based Configuration?

		@Configuration
		public class AppConfig
		{
			@Bean
			public MyService myService() {
				return new MyServiceImpl();
			}
		}
		
		
##	What is Spring Annotation-based Configuration?

-	Once <context:annotation-config/> is configured, you can start annotating your code to indicate that Spring should automatically wire values into properties, methods, and constructors.


##	Explain Spring Bean lifecycle?


-	Spring Bean lifecycle will be managed by spring container 
-	Spring lifecycle will be managed by calling life cycle methods
-	Spring lifecycle methods are categorized into post-initialization and pre-destruction


-	lifecycle methods 

	- 	init() and destroy()
	-	@PostConstruct and @PreDestroy
	
	
##	What are different Spring Bean Scopes?

-	singleton
-	prototype
-	session
-	request
-	global-session


##	What are inner beans in Spring?


-	whenever a bean is used for only one particular property, it’s advise to declare it as an inner bean
- 	And the inner bean is supported both in setter injection ‘property‘ and constructor injection ‘constructor-arg‘

			<bean id="CustomerBean" class="com.howtodoinjava.common.Customer">
				<property name="person">
					<!-- This is inner bean -->
					<bean class="com.howtodoinjava.common.Person">
						<property name="name" value="adminis"></property>
						<property name="address" value="India"></property>
						<property name="age" value="34"></property>
					</bean>
				</property>
			</bean>

			
##	Are Singleton beans thread safe in Spring Framework?

-	yes singleton beans are thread safe 


##	How can you inject a Java Collection in Spring? Give example?

-	Spring offers four types of collection configuration elements which are as follows:


		-	<list> : This helps in wiring ie injecting a list of values, allowing duplicates.
		-	<set> : This helps in wiring a set of values but without any duplicates.
		-	<map> : This can be used to inject a collection of name-value pairs where name and value can be of any type.
		-	<props> : This can be used to inject a collection of name-value pairs where the name and value are both Strings.
		
		
			
			<beans>
			
				<bean id="demoBean" class="com.guru.bharath.bean.DemoImpl">
				
					<property name="customList">
						<list>
							<value>abc</value>
							<value>abc</value>
							<value>abc</value>
						</list>
					</property>
					
					<property name="customSet">
						<set>
							<value>abc</value>
							<value>tyr</value>
							<value>Nuid</value>
						</set>
					</property>
					
					<property name="customMap">
						<map>
							<entry key=1 value="Canada"> 
							<entry key=2 value="USA"> 
							<entry key=3 value="UK"> 
						</map>
					</property>
					
					<property name="customProp">
						<props>
							<prop key="admin" value="aa@dd"/>
							<prop key="dev" value=""addfd"/>
						</props>
					</property>
				</bean>	
					
								
			
##	How to inject a java.util.Properties into a Spring Bean?


			<bean id="" class="">
				<property name="">
					<props>
						<prop key="" value="">
						<prop key="" value="">
						<prop key="" value="">
					</props>
			</bean>
			
			
			<util:properties id="emails" location="classpath:com/foo/emails.properties" />
			
			
##	Explain Spring Bean Autowiring?

-	autowiring in spring done by

	- 	no
	-	byName
	-	byType
	-	constructor
	
##	How do you turn on annotation based autowiring?

-	using below tag


		<beans>
			<context:annotation-config />
		</beans>		

##	Explain @Required annotation with example?

-	@Required is used to make sure that non-null value will injected to the property
-	It will used on setter method of the property


##	Explain @Autowired annotation with example?

-	@Autowired annotation is used to autowire the bean from spirng container to the property on the class
-	We can use @Autowired on top of constructor, field, setter methods, interface


##	Explain @Qualifier annotation with example?

-	@Qualifier is to autowire the specific bean by name when there were more than two beans of same type


##	Difference between constructor injection and setter injection?

-	Constructor injection support object immutability and thread safe 
-	Constructor injection will become difficult to manage if there were lots of parameters
-	setter injection will be easier to manage


##	Difference between FileSystemResource and ClassPathResource?

-	In FileSystemResource you need to give path of spring-config.xml (Spring Configuration) file relative to your project or the absolute location of the file
-	ClassPathResource looks in the class path and FileSystemResource looks in the file system


##	Name some of the design patterns used in Spring Framework?

-	factory
-	singleton
-	DI
-	front controller
-	Proxy - used heavily in AOP
-	builder pattern
-	template pattern - rest template, jdbc template, jms
-	adapter pattern
