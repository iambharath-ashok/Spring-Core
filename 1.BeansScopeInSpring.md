#	Spring bean scopes

![](https://cdn2.guru.bharath.com/wp-content/uploads/Spring-bean-scope.png)

-	There are 6 scopes in Spring 
-	4 of them were only available on Web Aware Application Context

	-	Singleton
	-	prototype
	-	request
	-	session
	-	application
	-	web socket scope
	
##	Spring Bean Scopes Type


SCOPE	| DESCRIPTION
-------|------------
singleton (default)	| Single bean object instance per spring IoC container
prototype	| Opposite to singleton, it produces a new instance each and every time a bean is requested.
request	| A single instance will be created and available during complete lifecycle of an HTTP request. Only valid in web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
session	| A single instance will be created and available during complete lifecycle of an HTTP Session.Only valid in web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
application	| A single instance will be created and available during complete lifecycle of ServletContext.Only valid in web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
websocket	| A single instance will be created and available during complete lifecycle of WebSocket.Only valid in web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
	
	
## Singleton:

-	This bean scope is default and it enforces the container to have only one instance per spring container irrespective of how much time we request for its instance
-	This singleton behavior is maintained by bean factory itself
				
					@Component
					//This statement is redundant - singleton is default scope
					@Scope("singleton")  //This statement is redundant
					public class BeanClass {
					 
					}
					
					<!-- To specify singleton scope is redundant -->
					<bean id="beanId" class="com.guru.bharath.BeanClass" scope="singleton" />
					//or
					<bean id="beanId" class="com.guru.bharath.BeanClass" />
					
##	Prototype

-	produces a new instance each and every time a bean is requested

				@Component
				@Scope("prototype")
				public class BeanClass {
				}
				
				<bean id="beanId" class="com.guru.bharath.BeanClass" scope="prototype" />
				
## Web Aware Application Context scopes

-	Remaining 3 bean scopes are web applications related
-	Essentially these are available through web aware application context (e.g. WebApplicationContext)


##	Request scope

-	A new bean instance will be created for each web request made by client
-	bean will be available during complete lifecycle of request
- 	As soon as request completes, bean will be out of scope and garbage collected
-	So, if server is currently handling 50 requests, then container can have at most 50 individual instances of bean class
-	Any state change to one instance, will not be visible to other instances
		
				@Component
				@Scope("request")
				public class BeanClass {
				}
				
				//or
 
				@Component
				@RequestScope
				public class BeanClass {
				}
				 
				<bean id="beanId" class="com.guru.bharath.BeanClass" scope="request" />
				
##	Session scope

-	This ensures one instance of bean per user session. As soon as user ends its session, bean is out of scope
-	Bean will available during complete lifecycle of session
-	As soon as user ends its session, bean is out of scope
-	So, if server has 20 active sessions, then container can have at most 20 individual instances of bean class
-	All HTTP requests within single session lifetime will have access to same single bean instance in that session scope
	
				@Component
				@Scope("session")
				public class BeanClass {
				}
				 
				//or
				 
				@Component
				@SessionScope
				public class BeanClass {
				}	
				
				<bean id="" class="com.guru.bharath.bean.scopes.SessionBean" 	scope="session"/>

				
## Application Scope

-	In application scope, container creates one instance per web application runtime i.e servlet context
-	It is almost similar to singleton scope, with only two differences i.e.

	-	application scoped bean is singleton per ServletContext, whereas singleton scoped bean is singleton per ApplicationContext. Please note that there can be multiple application contexts for single application
	
	-	application scoped bean is visible as a ServletContext attribute
	
	
				@Component
				@Scope("application")
				public class BeanClass {
				}
				 
				//or
				 
				@Component
				@ApplicationScope
				public class BeanClass {
				}
				
				
				<bean id="beanId" class="com.guru.bharath.BeanClass" scope="application" />
				
				
##	 websocket scope

-	The WebSocket Protocol enables two-way communication between a client and a remote host that has opted-in to communication with client
-	WebSocket Protocol provides a single TCP connection for traffic in both directions
-	This is specially useful for multi-user applications with simultaneous editing and multi-user games

				@Component
				@Scope("websocket")
				public class BeanClass {
				}
						
				<bean id="beanId" class="com.guru.bharath.BeanClass" scope="websocket" />		
				
				
				
##	Custom thread scope

-	Spring also provide a non-default thread scope using class SimpleThreadScope			
-	To use this scope, we must use register it to container using CustomScopeConfigurer class.
				
				
		<bean  class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.CustomScopeConfigurer">
			<property name="scopes">
				<map>
					<entry key="thread">
						<bean class=""/>
					</entry>
				</map>
			</property>
		</bean>
		
		@Component
		@Scope("thread")
		public class BeanClass {
		}
							
		<bean id="beanId" class="com.guru.bharath.BeanClass" scope="thread" />
				
##	global scope

-	It is something which is connected to Portlet applications


##	 How to define spring bean scope


		<beans>
			<bean id="" class="" scope="session"/>
		</beans>

		
		@Service
		@Scope("session")
		public class DemoBean {
		
		
		}
