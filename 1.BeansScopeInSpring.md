#	Spring bean scopes

![](https://cdn2.howtodoinjava.com/wp-content/uploads/Spring-bean-scope.png)

-	There are 5 scopes in Spring 

	-	Singleton
	-	prototype
	-	request
	-	session
	-	global session
	
	
## Singleton:

-	This bean scope is default and it enforces the container to have only one instance per spring container irrespective of how much time you request for its instance
-	This singleton behavior is maintained by bean factory itself

##	prototype

-	produces a new instance each and every time a bean is requested

## Web Aware Application Context

-	Remaining three bean scopes are web applications related
-	Essentially these are available through web aware application context (e.g. WebApplicationContext)


##	Request 

-	a new bean instance will be created for each web request made by client
- 	As soon as request completes, bean will be out of scope and garbage collected


##	Session

-	this ensures one instance of bean per user session. As soon as user ends its session, bean is out of scope

##	global-session

-	It is something which is connected to Portlet applications
