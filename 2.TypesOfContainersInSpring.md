#	Spring container types

-	Spring container scans for beans, register them and maintains their life cycle
-	The container will create the objects, wire them together, configure them, and manage their complete life cycle from creation till destruction
-	The Spring container uses dependency injection (DI) to manage the components that make up an application


##	Spring provides following two distinct types of containers


-	BeanFactory container(I)
-	ApplicationContext container(I)


## BeanFactory container

-	A BeanFactory is essentially nothing more than the interface 
-	XmlBeanFactory is the implementation of BeanFactory(I)
-	The BeanFactory enables to read bean definitions and access them using the bean factory


		InputStream is = new FileInputStream("beans.xml");
		BeanFactory factory = new XmlBeanFactory(is);
		 
		//Get bean
		HelloWorld obj = (HelloWorld) factory.getBean("helloWorld");
		
		
		
##	ApplicationContext(I) container


-	org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext is an interface and has many implementations like ClassPathXmlApplicationContext ,FileSystemXmlApplicationContext 
-	WebXmlApplicationContext -	This container loads the XML file with definitions of all beans from within a web application

-	ApplicationContext container adds more enterprise-specific functionality 
	-	Such as the ability to resolve textual messages from a properties file
-	Ability to publish application events to interested event listeners
