#	IOC vs DI


## IOC 

-	IOC is a design paradigm
-	IOC is used to define loose coupling b/w modules
-	IOC	determines the functionality flow at runtime
-	IOC is achived through DI

-	Inversion of control as a design guideline serves the following purposes:

	-	Every module can focus on what it is designed for.
	-	Modules make no assumptions about what other systems do but rely on their contracts
	-	Replacing modules has no side effect on other modules.


##	What is DI – Dependency Injection

-	DI is design pattern
-	DI is used to create objects that other object depends on it and injecting them at runtime
-	IoC relies on dependency injection because a mechanism is needed in order to activate the components providing the specific functionality

### Use case for Authentication


-	First for attom application we were using centurylink mnet RESTful API service for authentication
-	Then we switechted authentication mechanism to ldap service
-	Here rest of the functionality continues to continue to work with any further modification
-	The two concepts work together in this way to allow for much more flexible, reusable, and encapsulated code to be written

##	How to implement IoC

-	using a factory pattern
-	using a service locator pattern
-	using a dependency injection of any given below type:

	-	a constructor injection
	-	a setter injection
	-	an interface injection
	
##	IoC in Spring Framework	

-	The BeanFactory interface is the central IoC container interface in Spring


##	How to create beans in Spring

###	Using constructor


-	When creating a bean using the constructor approach, all normal classes are usable by and compatible with Spring
-	classes dont needs to implement or extend any special interface or classes
-	We just needs to define them in the xml file 


##	 Using static factory method

-	When defining a bean which is to be created using a static factory method, along with the class attribute which specifies the class containing the static factory method
	-	 another attribute named factory-method is needed to specify the name of the factory method itself
	
			<bean id="exampleBean" factory-method="createInstance"/>
				
##	Using instance factory method

-	similar to instantiation via a static factory method, instantiation using an instance factory method is where the factory method of an existing bean from the container is invoked to create the new bean.

			<bean id="myFactoryBean"  class="...">	 
			<bean id="exampleBean"  factory-bean="myFactoryBean" factory-method="createInstance"></bean>	
			
##	Dependency Injection in Spring Framework

-	Setter Injection
-	Constructor Injection
-	Field based Injection


##	Constructor Injection
			
			
			@Configuration
			public class AppConfig {
			 
				@Bean
				public Item item1() {
					return new ItemImpl1();
				}
			 
				@Bean
				public Store store() {
					return new Store(item1());
				}
			}


			<bean id="item1" class="org.baeldung.store.ItemImpl1" /> 
			<bean id="store" class="org.baeldung.store.Store"> 
				<constructor-arg type="ItemImpl1" index="0" name="item" ref="item1" /> 
			</bean>
	

##	Setter-Based Dependency Injection

			@Bean
			public Store store() {
				Store store = new Store();
				store.setItem(item1());
				return store;
			}
			
			
			<bean id="store" class="org.baeldung.store.Store">
				<property name="item" ref="item1" />
			</bean>
			
			
##	Field-Based Dependency Injection

-	In case of Field-Based DI, we can inject the dependencies by marking them with an @Autowired annotation


			public class Store {
				@Autowired
				private Item item; 
			}
	
	
##	Autowiring Dependencies

-	no
-	byName
-	byType
-	constructor

-	no:
	-	this is the default
	-	this means no autowiring is used for the bean and we have to explicitly name the dependencies
	
-	byName:
	-	Spring will look for the bean with same name as property 
	
				public class Store {
     
					@Autowired
					@Qualifier("item1")
					private Item item;
				}
				
				<bean id="item" class="org.baeldung.store.ItemImpl1" />
 
				<bean id="store" class="org.baeldung.store.Store" autowire="byName">
				</bean>
				
-	byType:

	-	Spring will look for bean with same type as property
	-	If there’s more than one bean of that type, the framework throws an exception
	
				@Bean(autowire = Autowire.BY_TYPE)
				public class Store {
					 
					private Item item;
				 
					public setItem(Item item){
						this.item = item;    
					}
				}
				
				public class Store {
     
					@Autowired
					private Item item;
				}
				
				<bean id="store" class="org.baeldung.store.Store" autowire="byType"> </bean>
				
-	constructor
	-	autowiring is done based on constructor arguments
	-	meaning Spring will look for beans with the same type as the constructor arguments

	
##	 Lazy Initialized Beans

-	The container creates and configures all singleton beans during initialization
-	To avoid this, we can use the lazy-init attribute with value true on the bean configuration:
-	The item1 bean will be initialized only when it’s first requested, and not at startup


			<bean id="item1" class="org.baeldung.store.ItemImpl1" lazy-init="true" />

##	IoC vs DI Interview Questions

###	What is difference between component and service?


###	How DI is different from Service locator pattern?


-	Service Locator is a design pattern in which single object is knows how to get hold of all of the services that an application might need
-	It then scans all such services and store them as a singleton Registry
-	When asked for a service implementation, a requester can query the registry with a token and get appropriate implementation
-	JNDI lookup for particular ejb bean
-	Mostly these registries are populated via some configuration files
-	The key difference is that with a Service Locator every user of a service has a dependency to the locator
- 	The locator can hide dependencies to other implementations, but we do need to see the locator


##	Which one should be better to use i.e. service locator or dependency injection?

-	DI as we dont need to bother about service locator
-	In service locator, we should have an dependency on the service locator



##	Which is better constructor injection or setter injection?

-	Constructor injection will be helpful for immutable object. Having setter may break the immutability
-	Constructor injection looks messy if there were lot of arguments for constructor
-	With setter injection we can give each setter a name to indicate what the string is supposed to do


##	What is Bean Factory ?

-	Its container factory for all the beans

##	What is Application Context?

-	Its container factory built on top of Bean Factory
-	Supports enterprise features  trasaction management, web aware, AOP etc

		
	-	A means for resolving text messages, including support for internationalization.
	-	A generic way to load file resources.
	-	Events to beans that are registered as listeners
	
##	What are the common implementations of the Application Context?

-	ClassPathXmlApplicationContext 
-	FileSystemXmlApplicationContext 
-	XmlWebApplicationContext


##	What should be used preferably BeanFactory or ApplicationContext?

-	A BeanFactory pretty much just instantiates and configures beans
-	An ApplicationContext also does that, and it provides the supporting infrastructure to enable lots of enterprise-specific features such as transactions and AOP
