#	Spring static factory-method

-	In Spring framework, if we want to create a bean by invoking a static factory-method
-	whose purpose is to encapsulate the object-creation process in a static method then we could use factory-method attribute

##	Static factory method


-	If we want to create different EmployeeDTO objects based on itâ€™s designation using a static factory method, we can do it like below example.


			public class EmployeeDTO {
 
				private Integer id;
				private String firstName;
				private String lastName;
			 
				private String designation;
			 
				//Setters and Getters
			 
				@Override
				public String toString() {
					return "Employee [id=" + id + ", firstName=" + firstName
							+ ", lastName=" + lastName + ", type=" + designation + "]";
				}
			}


##	Create static factory 


			public class EmployeeFactory {
     
				public static EmployeeDTO createEmployeeOfType(String type)
				{
					if ("manager".equals(type) || "director".equals(type))
					{
						EmployeeDTO employee = new EmployeeDTO();
						 
						employee.setId(-1);
						employee.setFirstName("dummy");
						employee.setLastName("dummy");
						//Set designation here
						employee.setDesignation(type);
						 
						return employee;
					}
					else
					{
						throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown product");
					}
				}
			}
			
			
-	Use factory-method attribute for creating the beans.

				<bean id="manager" class="com.guru.bharath.demo.factory.EmployeeFactory"
					factory-method="createEmployeeOfType">
					<constructor-arg value="manager" />
				</bean>
				 
				<bean id="director" class="com.guru.bharath.demo.factory.EmployeeFactory"
					factory-method="createEmployeeOfType">
					<constructor-arg value="director" />
				</bean>

##	Demo

	
					public class TestSpringStaticFactoryMethod
					{
						@SuppressWarnings("resource")
						public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
						{
							ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");
					 
							EmployeeDTO manager = (EmployeeDTO) context.getBean("manager");
							System.out.println(manager);
							 
							EmployeeDTO director = (EmployeeDTO) context.getBean("director");
							System.out.println(director);
						}
					}
					
					
					
##	Spring FactoryBean

-	A factory bean is a bean that serves as a factory for creating other beans within the IoC container.
-	Conceptually, a factory bean is very similar to a factory method
-	but it is a Spring-specific bean that can be identified by the Spring IoC container during bean construction and can be used by container to instantiate other beans
